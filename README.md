MLB players are constantly judged by their performance statistics. But can that be translated into a manager statstic that shows the highest performing managers to the lowest performing? The idea is to create a "Frankenstein" statistic that is almost like a WAR statistic but for managers. 

More code, ideas, findings, outcomes to come.
